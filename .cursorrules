This project is about building an investment website where users can invest and the admin can manage the users and their investments. Here are some features and functionalities of what the users or admin can do.


User module
I want to build an investment dashboard where users can have: 

    Authentication:
        Basic sign-up, login, reset the password, and verify email address.
        Onboarding will be KYC, which is optional:
        To complete KYC, the user will have to provide their country of residence and upload an image of a valid government-issued ID  
        If the user skips this step, they can’t use their wallet or purchase or invest in properties. Each time they try to use this restricted access, a modal popup will show up to tell them to complete KYC and await approval from the admin. 

    Wallet: 
        Wallet balance with chart and transaction history of transactions. 
        i. Deposit funds: Users will set an amount they want to deposit and copy either of the two types of wallet addresses provided by the admin (BTC, USDT - TRC 20), an input field to provide their transaction ID  after they have made a deposit, then click confirm deposit button. This will be sent to the admin for confirmation
        ii. Withdraw funds: users will enter the amount, choose crypto, enter the wallet address they want to withdraw to and send a withdrawal request. 

    Investments : 
    Below are the sub-navigations and their functionalities:
        Real estate:
            i. Users can see and buy properties. Users can see each property's details. To purchase property, the user can either choose to pay instalments (2 or 3) or pay at once from their wallet balance
            ii. Users can see a list of real estate plans which can be called “shares” When the user clicks to invest each of the shares, they will pick a plan (semi-annual contract ($300,000 - $700,000 USD), annual contract ($1.5M to $2M), then enter the amount they want to invest and click “ invest” from their wallet balance
        My portfolio:
            i. Shares history: User can see lists of investments and withdraw matured investments to wallets
            ii. Properties: Users can see lists of the properties they have purchased, and instalments will be withdrawn from wallets automatically until it's paid. Users will always get reminders about their instalments
        Green energy: 
            i. Users can see and buy equipment. Users can see a detail page for each equipment. To purchase, user will enter their delivery address to pay using their wallet balance. 
            ii. Users can see a list of real estate plans which can be called “shares” When the user clicks to invest each of the shares, they will pick a plan (semi-annual contract ($300,000 - $700,000 USD), annual contract ($1.5M to $2M), then enter the amount they want to invest and click “ invest” from their wallet balance
        My portfolio:
            i. Shares history: User can see lists of investments and withdraw matured investments to wallets
            ii. Equipment: users can see lists of the Equipment they have purchased
        Markets:
            i. Users can see 3 market plans and choose which plan and amount they want to invest from their wallet balance. 
            ii. My portfolio: User can see lists of investments and withdraw matured investments to wallets
        
        User Profile: 
            User can make changes to their account details
            Change password
            Complete KYC : Complete simple KYC by submitting details to the admin so they can approve the profile. Without KYC, users can’t invest, use wallets or purchase any property or equipment. 
            Referral Program:
            Users can see the referral link and a table to see those they have referred and the amount of commission earned. 
            Notification: 
            Users can see the inbox of emails or alerts sent to them from the admin.
